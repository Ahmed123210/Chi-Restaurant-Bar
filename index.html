If I could give it six stars, I would.  The beef tenderloin with truffle was a revelation—melt-in-your-mouth tender, luxuriously earthy, and seared with such precision it felt like culinary alchemy. The truffle didn’t overpower; it danced in harmony with the beef, adding elegance without stealing the spotlight.  Then came the sliced cabbage and pork, which was anything but humble. Smoky, savory, and whispering with umami, it struck that perfect balance between homestyle comfort and elevated flavor. Every bite had crunch, soul, and depth—this dish deserves its own fan club.  Before that symphony began, we kicked things off with a mashed eggplant and pepper appetizer that was bright, bold, and addictive. Silky eggplant and punchy pepper created a flavor bomb that lingered just long enough to make you crave the next bite.  Service was gracious and efficient, and the ambiance struck a chord—modern, understated, and just refined enough to match the cuisine without being pretentious.

However, we were abruptly denied further service by our server, who stated in front of everyone that the tip left on the card was not enough; a humiliating and unprofessional comment made loudly and publicly at our table.  What the server didn’t know, and didn’t ask, was that my partner and I had planned to leave an additional cash tip before leaving. I even offered twice to increase the card tip on the spot, but was refused. The server still declined to provide further service. We were left sitting, unable to order anything else, despite our willingness to continue supporting the restaurant and compensate accordingly.  To make matters worse, we were seated in an isolated back corner, and the entire interaction gave a clear impression that we were unwelcome. As a woman of color and a tourist, this experience was embarrassing, unnecessary, and disappointing. What should have been a relaxing, social evening turned into an uncomfortable situation that left a lasting impression for all the wrong reasons.  Chi Restaurant and Bar must seriously reevaluate its staff training, particularly around professionalism, guest engagement, and cultural sensitivity.

    <div class="review-card negative" data-restaurant="Chi Restaurant & Bar" data-stars="2" data-text="Food was veeery good and at a correct price point but unfortunately we didn't felt treated well at all: they seated us (2ppl) in a 4-5 seat table because they screwed with the reservations, even we said we could wait for some minutes if they preferred to allocate us in a smaller table. They refused but then our main waiter was really rude for the whole time: he appeared at the table just as we were sitting and we haven't had time to check the menu; then we have to wait for about 15' extra minutes to order. We were in no hurry so it wasn't a huge deal for us, but then he proceed to rush us through all the meal just like if they wanted us out. He/they forgot one of the drinks until we were almost finishing our main dishes. When we finished, he brought the bill without asking if we were finished or wanted desserts (their bad, obviously at this point we started being very disappointed). Couple of minutes after that he brought the credit card terminal and we tried 3 different credit cards that had been working perfectly well during the previous 8 days in the US (and kept working for 2 more days) and the three of them failed. We offered then to pay cash, and then he told us that if paying cash, tip was at 20% minimum, so he started trying that we paid 25-30% tip, accusing us of not knowing about how tips work in the US. At this point, we were sure he was trying to mess with us and, again, it was'nt our first day there, nor our first trip there. We asked for a manager and he offered somebody who spoke spanish. When another much nicer waiter came, the first one started explaining a different story about how the problem was that all our cards were failing. I stoped him and asked directly the 2nd waiter if price and tip were different if paying with card or in cash. Since he immediately responded that there was no price or tip difference, we agreed in a minimum tip, we paid cash and we left, saddened by our only bad experience in our trip there. We really enjoyed the food and I only write bad reviews very exceptionally because we understand anyone can have a bad day, but we really hope this guy reconsiders his attitude to customers, because feeling welcome is as important as the food.

We found the restaurant through Google. We were greeted, welcomed, and seated almost immediately even though it looked like the entire restaurant and bar were filled  We immediately had a waitstaff bring water and menus.  We ordered from the American-inspired menu as my wife is used to certain foods, so while i looked longingly at the curry shrimp noodles, we ended up ordering Kung Pao Shrimp, Spicy Cabbage and Pork, and Fried Rice with Chicken. The staff was very accommodating to our dietary needs and made the rice as requested (without egg).  The food came within a reasonable amount of time. Given the number of customers and the size of the menu, it was understandable, but even so, it was very fast.  The Kung Pao Shrimp was delicious. Sweet and spicy, with jumbo shrimp in the spicy sauce.  The Fried Rice with Chicken was tasty also.  For me, the standout was the Spicy Cabbage with Pork. The cabbage is very roughly chopped and sauteed in an incredibly flavorful umami sauce with a nice kick of heat (spicier than the Kung Pao Shrimp). The pork appeared to be sliced pork belly with a beautiful unctuous mouth deal from the fatty meat.  Stellar meal!  The one knock is perhaps due to the popularity and the delightfulness of the food, but the tables are very small, which made it difficult for us to share our food together.  I wish I could say 4.5 stars, but Google demands Integer values.  A wonderful find in the theatre district! My wife and I came in for dinner around 6:30 pm without a reservation.

The one knock is perhaps due to the popularity and the delightfulness of the food, but the tables are very small, which made it difficult for us to share our food together.  I wish I could say 4.5 stars, but Google demands Integer values.  A wonderful find in the theatre district!</p>

      <p class="translated">My wife and I came in for dinner around 6:30 pm without a reservation. We found the restaurant through Google. We were greeted, welcomed, and seated almost immediately even though it looked like the entire restaurant and bar were filled  We immediately had a waitstaff bring water and menus.  We ordered from the American-inspired menu as my wife is used to certain foods, so while i looked longingly at the curry shrimp noodles, we ended up ordering Kung Pao Shrimp, Spicy Cabbage and Pork, and Fried Rice with Chicken. The staff was very accommodating to our dietary needs and made the rice as requested (without egg).  The food came within a reasonable amount of time. Given the number of customers and the size of the menu, it was understandable, but even so, it was very fast.  The Kung Pao Shrimp was delicious. Sweet and spicy, with jumbo shrimp in the spicy sauce.  The Fried Rice with Chicken was tasty also.  For me, the standout was the Spicy Cabbage with Pork. The cabbage is very roughly chopped and sauteed in an incredibly flavorful umami sauce with a nice kick of heat (spicier than the Kung Pao Shrimp). The pork appeared to be sliced pork belly with a beautiful unctuous mouth deal from the fatty meat.  Stellar meal!

I started with “The Silk Road” mocktail, a refreshing blend of lychee and rose, followed by the “Summer Palace,” which offered a vibrant mix of passion fruit and pineapple. Both drinks were beautifully balanced.  The Ma-La Trio was an exciting start to the meal, from the chili-doused poached chicken to the Szechuan peppercorn-infused duck. The Crispy Shrimp Balls were another highlight, perfectly cooked with a delightful spicy aioli and crunchy shredded potatoes. However, the “Birds of a Feather Mao Xue Wang” stole the show. This dish featured two distinct Szechuan chili broths, with meat and vegetables cooked and complemented by the fiery, fragrant sauces.  The meal concluded with the Hong Cha Tea Ice Cream, a unique dessert with its rich Chinese black tea ice cream and honey anise caramel.  Chi Restaurant & Bar is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Chinese cuisines with a modern twist. Highly recommended for an immersive and flavorful dining experience!

The food quality went down and the prices went up. Surely not a place on my priority." data-date="2025-01-01">

    <div class="review-card positive" data-restaurant="Chi Restaurant & Bar" data-stars="5" data-text="Update: Visited again to try their other dishes. The mala trio provided a nice variety of duck, chicken, and cucumber with a mild mala flavor. The wok fried cabbage with pork had a nice charred flavor. I loved the crispy shrimp balls which were decently size shrimp in a fried batter, sticky sweet sauce, and fried pieces of potato confetti without being too greasy. Everything from the dishes to the drinks came out in fancy plating, which elevated the experience. The waitresses were super friendly and checked in with us very often. It was unfortunate that the bartender wasn’t available this visit since my partner wanted to try some other cocktails. We will be visiting frequently.  Original review: All the food was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The braised pork belly would have been perfect if you could order some bao buns to eat with it. The mala beef jerky was the perfect balance between spiciness and mala. The jasmine tea was the best I’ve ever had and the pot is bigger than most other restaurants. The soup dumplings were delicious but not the best I’ve ever had. This is a weird thing to mention but the jasmine rice was okay - it was lukewarm and didn’t have the fragrance of jasmine I’m used to. The service was great until the end when I think they forgot about us and it took a while to order dessert, but we weren’t in a rush. Overall, I’d definitely come back to try out their other dishes. Update: Visited again to try their other dishes. The mala trio provided a nice variety of duck, chicken, and cucumber with a mild mala flavor. The wok fried cabbage with pork had a nice charred flavor. I loved the crispy shrimp balls which were decently size shrimp in a fried batter, sticky sweet sauce, and fried pieces of potato confetti without being too greasy. Everything from the dishes to the drinks came out in fancy plating, which elevated the experience. The waitresses were super friendly and checked in with us very often. It was unfortunate that the bartender wasn’t available this visit since my partner wanted to try some other cocktails. We will be visiting frequently.  Original review: All the food was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The braised pork belly would have been perfect if you could order some bao buns to eat with it.

      <p class="translated">I dined in person and had a lovely meal. The waiters are a bit hard to flag down, but the food is very good. Because of my good experience, I decided to order take out. Do not do this!! I waited for an hour only for my order to be cancelled. The restaurant claimed they were having an order with DoorDash, but DoorDash was giving my progress updates every few minutes because Chi had accepted the order. No less than FOUR delivery people were assigned to my order, and each of them left after waiting for a long time for my food to be ready — I don’t blame the delivery people for leaving at all! Don’t accept online orders if you cannot fulfill them. I don’t think I’ll be back.  The worst part is that, even though DoorDash refunded my order, the restaurant escapes culpability for this inexcusable service.</p>

The restaurant is beautiful. My waitress was kind and attentive, answering all of my questions about what dishes other tables ordered. The presentation of every drink and meal in the whole restaurant were clearly designed to be awe-inspiring. When I spend money at this price point, I always hope my experience will be like what Chi Restaurant and Bar provided me today.  First, I ordered the Dragon Paradise cocktail. It is described as having tea, rum, pandan, coconut, yogurt, dairy, and citrus. To me, it tastes like a creamy piña colada with tea in it. It was trippy because the drink is actually see-through but it tastes like it would be a creamy white color. I enjoyed it!  Then, I ordered a Szechuan Cucumber Salad as an appetizer and it was so flavorful. It was salty, vinegary, spicy, and more. I honestly would say if you come here, you have to try it. It's that good.  My entree was the Truffle Beef Tenderloin, which again, came out with amazing presentation and was so full of flavor. The mushrooms and beef were all coated in a caramelized layer of sweet and salty. There were just enough diced peppers in the dish to keep a welcome spiciness in each bite.  I then had fried pumpkin rice cakes and a separate vanilla gelato scoop dessert, which I ate together making the perfect mix of flavors for me.  Great meal. Great experience.

My waitress was kind and attentive, answering all of my questions about what dishes other tables ordered. The presentation of every drink and meal in the whole restaurant were clearly designed to be awe-inspiring. When I spend money at this price point, I always hope my experience will be like what Chi Restaurant and Bar provided me today.  First, I ordered the Dragon Paradise cocktail. It is described as having tea, rum, pandan, coconut, yogurt, dairy, and citrus. To me, it tastes like a creamy piña colada with tea in it. It was trippy because the drink is actually see-through but it tastes like it would be a creamy white color. I enjoyed it!  Then, I ordered a Szechuan Cucumber Salad as an appetizer and it was so flavorful. It was salty, vinegary, spicy, and more. I honestly would say if you come here, you have to try it. It's that good.  My entree was the Truffle Beef Tenderloin, which again, came out with amazing presentation and was so full of flavor. The mushrooms and beef were all coated in a caramelized layer of sweet and salty. There were just enough diced peppers in the dish to keep a welcome spiciness in each bite.  I then had fried pumpkin rice cakes and a separate vanilla gelato scoop dessert, which I ate together making the perfect mix of flavors for me.  Great meal. Great experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Original:</strong> I’m so glad that I found this restaurant. The lobster with salted egg yolk sauce is delicious. I’ve never had this style of lobster before. That was a good choice I made. The eggplant is also really good. I will definitely come back here with my friends so I can try more dishes since there are so many interesting dishes that I’ve never had before. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is nice and elegant. If you’re near the Hudson yard, you must try this restaurant.</p>

I asked server it has so much of sichuan peppercorn so cant eat if they can make with less but servee said can’t do anything for it seriously whats the service for? I believe she didn’t understand she said it is spicy but spicy was not our problem it was not spicy for us it just had so much peppercorn that it tasted so weird .she suggested something medium spicy which was not the problem or solution. I wish i could make them understand what the problem was with me anyways. So basically they just serve you whatever they like doesn’t matter you like it or not. It is what it is. So we have to pay for what we can’t even eat and am not upset because i have to pay but because they were just just concerned about the cost instead of customer. Other person came to ask if you are done i said no am working on it but he took it, i don’t know if they didn’t understand my words. I had off experience. I was not impressed at all so it was my last visit. Just Hope this place prioritizes little bit on customer satisfaction. Good luck. Went to the restaurant for dinner. The place looked nice.

      <p><strong>Original:</strong> Wife and I ordered ma-la trio appetizer, truffle beef and pork trotters for entree. The food was served rather quickly and it was exceptional, but you have to watch your spice tolerance as ours was tested to the limit with just 2 out of 3 spice/pepper levels for our dishes. Service was top notch and the place was clean, well maintained and appointed. The bill was a bit higher than in many other Asian restaurants,  but you do get what you pay for. We did find the menu, which had both authentic and Americanized options, kind of hard to navigate and choose from. We had to ask our waiter to identify the dishes for us by the photos people posted in the reviews. We did discover afterwards though that the on-line menu has photos which help with the identification.</p>

    <div class="review-card positive" data-restaurant="Chi Restaurant & Bar" data-stars="5" data-text="I recently stumbled upon Chi Restaurant through Resy’s newsletter, and as I perused their menu, I knew I had to make a visit. I'm always intrigued by Asian restaurants that are willing to elevate traditional flavors and combine them with a good bar program. So, trying out Chi was both research and pleasure for me.  Located in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, Chi 棋 (which means chess in Chinese) is a newly opened restaurant that fully incorporates its theme in the decorations and menu. Chinese idioms related to chess are cleverly used on the menu, adding another layer of fun to the dining experience.  Despite it being our third lunch outing, we decided to order quite a few dishes to try. We started with the 将相和, a cold appetizer trio consisting of poached chicken in chili sauce, duck in green vine pepper oil, and cucumber salad. The appetizers were well-prepared with just the right amount of spiciness and flavors, leaving us eager for more. We then moved on to the 滋补汤, a chicken and pork rib soup with ginseng that had a light and delicious broth with a hint of herb from the ginseng. It was quite enjoyable.  Next up, we tried the 金字塔的秘密, a steamed pork belly dish that was shaped like a pagoda and stuffed with preserved cabbage and castelvetrano olives (although it's no longer on the menu). The dish was prepared traditionally, and I found it to be quite satisfying. We also had the 干锅藕片, a wok-tossed lotus root with pork belly, and the 咸蛋黄白玉菇, sautéed mushrooms with preserved egg yolk. The lotus root and pork belly were a perfect combination, and I thoroughly enjoyed the savory flavor of the sautéed mushrooms with the preserved egg yolk.  My friend ordered the SzeChuan vesper to go with her meal, which consisted of vodka and gin, rice and lillet, five spice chili oil, citrus, and castelvetrano olives. It was a delicious cocktail that complemented her meal perfectly. Overall, our dining experience at Chi was a success, and we truly enjoyed the flavors, presentation, and ambiance of the restaurant.

We got Scallion pancakes and soup dumplings for appetizer and loved both. Spring rolls are crunchy as hell, yum. Pork wonton soup was okay but we loved the wok seared superior beef slices, again spicy. Lo mein beef noodle was also yummy. Tea lovers will fall in love with their Jasmine tea and its pot.

Used to order and eat from Ollie's because that's the only other *nicer* Chinese places around the area..but now......CHI is the spot!!! If you have been hesitant.. don't be!!! The fried chicken wings, fried rice, steamed soup dumplings, pan fried noodles, chicken and broccoli, pea shoots with garlic.  So good!!!!!!  There were only 4 more people dining in during lunch.

We ordered 5 different dishes and none of them disappointed us.   Used to order and eat from Ollie's because that's the only other *nicer* Chinese places around the area..but now......CHI is the spot!!! If you have been hesitant.. don't be!!! The fried chicken wings, fried rice, steamed soup dumplings, pan fried noodles, chicken and broccoli, pea shoots with garlic.  So good!!!!!!  There were only 4 more people dining in during lunch.  Hope this place stays open because it's a 10!!!!" data-date="2022-10-18">
